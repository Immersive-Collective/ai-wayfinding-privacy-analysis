# AI Wayfinding Companion â€“ Privacy & Security Analysis

## Overview

This repository presents a technical, constructive analysis and critique of privacy and security issues found in modern AI-based wayfinding companion applications. These systems leverage technologies such as Visual Positioning Systems (VPS), real-time visual analysis, and third-party AI services to provide navigation and context-aware assistance. While promising in terms of user experience and accessibility, they introduce significant privacy and security challenges that must be critically evaluated.

## Key Areas of Analysis

### 1. Continuous Visual Data Capture

* **Issue:**
  Real-time camera usage captures sensitive information from both users and bystanders, often without explicit consent or awareness.
* **Risks:**
  Unintentional collection of PII, exposure of private property, lack of bystander consent.
* **Recommendations:**

  * Implement explicit user controls for image capture.
  * Integrate real-time anonymization (e.g., face blurring).
  * Display visual indicators when capturing.

### 2. Precise Location Tracking

* **Issue:**
  Persistent VPS/GPS tracking enables fine-grained user movement profiling.
* **Risks:**
  Location data misuse, tracking, or leaks; increased risk of profiling.
* **Recommendations:**

  * Minimize location data retention.
  * Offer granular location privacy controls to users.
  * Provide transparency on data storage and deletion.

### 3. Third-Party Service Integrations

* **Issue:**
  Multiple vendors process sensitive data, raising exposure risks.
* **Risks:**
  Data shared with external parties, unknown data handling practices.
* **Recommendations:**

  * Clearly disclose all third-party data flows.
  * Minimize data sent to each partner.
  * Establish binding privacy and security agreements.

### 4. Data Retention and User Autonomy

* **Issue:**
  Insufficient transparency or control over how long data is kept.
* **Risks:**
  Excessive data retention, accidental data exposure.
* **Recommendations:**

  * Default to ephemeral data storage.
  * Provide user tools for data review and deletion.
  * Publicly document retention timelines.

### 5. Bystander and Environmental Privacy

* **Issue:**
  Cameras may record people or private property without consent.
* **Risks:**
  Bystander privacy violations, legal compliance risks.
* **Recommendations:**

  * Anonymize or mask non-user data by default.
  * Provide clear indicators when recording is active.

### 6. Voice and Audio Data Risks

* **Issue:**
  Always-on microphones may inadvertently record conversations.
* **Risks:**
  Capture of sensitive or non-consensual audio.
* **Recommendations:**

  * Use local wake-word detection.
  * Provide hardware/software microphone mute controls.

### 7. Cloud vs. Edge Processing

* **Issue:**
  Offloading data to the cloud can increase exposure and attack surface.
* **Risks:**
  Interception, unauthorized access, third-party analysis.
* **Recommendations:**

  * Prefer on-device (edge) processing for sensitive operations.
  * Encrypt all data sent to cloud services.

### 8. Potential for Profiling and Surveillance

* **Issue:**
  Combined visual, location, and interaction data can enable profiling.
* **Risks:**
  Surveillance, targeted advertising, data misuse.
* **Recommendations:**

  * Prohibit use of collected data for profiling/ads.
  * Regularly audit data practices for compliance.

### 9. Security and Attack Surface

* **Issue:**
  Complex integrations and real-time data flows expand attack vectors.
* **Risks:**
  Data breaches, service compromise, unauthorized access.
* **Recommendations:**

  * Conduct regular security audits.
  * Use strong encryption in transit and at rest.
